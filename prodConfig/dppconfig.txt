# Individual Settings 
#*****************************************************************

# The following settings are usually applied on channel by channel
# basis; however, you can put them also in the [COMMON] section in
# order to apply them to all the channels. If settings appear in
# both the common and individual sections, the final definition
# (furthest toward the bottom) takes preference.



# ENABLE_INPUT: enable/disable one channel.
# options: YES, NO
ENABLE_INPUT NO


# DC_OFFSET: DC offset adjust (DAC channel setting) in percent of the Full Scale. 
# -50: analog input dynamic range = -Vpp to 0 (negative signals)

# of each bank to set the RECORD_LENGTH for each bank. The even channel must have input
