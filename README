DAQ and Analysis code for Neutron Total Cross Sections
--------------------------------------------------------------

This software is a data acquisition (DAQ) and analysis package
for measuring neutron total cross sections. It uses a CAEN
waveform digitizer (from the x730 series) with proprietary DAQ software
(developed by Ron Fox @ CAEN for Washington University in St Louis) to record data.

The project consists of three parts:
    - ./WashUDAQ, which contains configuration files, software, and documentation
    for recording data from the x730 digitizer.

    - ./analysis, which contains software for analyzing the recorded data with
    the ROOT analysis package, producing cross sections, plots, and diagnostics.

    - ./<exp name>, which contains experiment-specific data (which runs to
    use for producing cross sections, target information, etc).

See the README files in each of these directories for more information.
