ACQUISITION_MODE MIXED
LIST_PARAMS ENERGY_AND_TIME

LIST_OUT_MODE ASCII

# RECORD_LENGTH = number of samples in the acquisition window
RECORD_LENGTH  4000


# EXTERNAL_TRIGGER: external trigger input settings. When enabled, the ext. trg. can be either 
# propagated (ACQUISITION_AND_TRGOUT) or not (ACQUISITION_ONLY) through the TRGOUT
# options: DISABLED, ACQUISITION_ONLY, ACQUISITION_AND_TRGOUT
EXTERNAL_TRIGGER   ACQUISITION_ONLY


# MAX_NUM_EVENTS_BLT: maximum number of events to read out in one Block Transfer. High values corresponds to 
# options: 0 to 1023
MAX_NUM_AGGREGATES_BLT  255

# NEVT_AGGR <n>: Number of Events per Aggregate. Use small values for low rates, or high values for high rates.
# options:
#	<n> = 1 to 1023 -> set number of events per aggregate to <n> (use only in list mode)
#	<n> = 0 -> Automatic mode (for high rates and best performance in list mode)
NEVT_AGGR	0

# PRE_TRIGGER: pre trigger size in number of samples
# options: 1 to 511
PRE_TRIGGER 40 

# TRG_HOLDOFF: trigger hold off in ns
# range: 0 - 1920 in steps of 128 ns
TRG_HOLDOFF 0

# FPIO_LEVEL: type of the front panel I/O LEMO connectors 
# options: NIM, TTL
FPIO_LEVEL  NIM

SELF_TRIGGER ENABLED

GATED_START DISABLED

# WRITE_REGISTER: generic write register access. This command allows the user to have a direct write access to the
# registers of the board. NOTE: all the direct write accesses are executed before the other setting, thus it might
# happen that one specific setting overwrites the regsiter content.
# Syntax: WRITE_REGISTER ADDRESS DATA, where ADDRESS is the address offset of the register (16 bit hex)
# and DATA is the value being written (31 bit hex)
# Example: WRITE_REGISTER  1080  00000010  # Set the threshold of channel 0 to 16 ADC counts (hex 10)
#  WRITE_REGISTER  8168  8

# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Individual Settings 
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# The following setting are usually applied on channel by channel
# basis; however, you can put them also in the [COMMON] section in
# ordere to apply them to all the channels.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------

# ENABLE_INPUT: enable/disable one channel (or one group in the case of the Mod 740)
# options: YES, NO

# DC_OFFSET: DC offset adjust (DAC channel setting) in percent of the Full Scale. 
# -50: analog input dynamic range = -Vpp to 0 (negative signals)
# +50: analog input dynamic range = 0 to +Vpp (positive signals)
# 0:   analog input dynamic range = -Vpp/2 to +Vpp/2 (bipolar signals)
# options: -50.0 to 50.0  (floating point)
DC_OFFSET              0

# TRIGGER_THRESHOLD: threshold for the channel auto trigger (ADC counts)
# options 0 to 2^N-1 (N=Number of bit of the ADC)

# CHANNEL_TRIGGER: channel auto trigger settings. When enabled, the ch. auto trg. can be either 
# propagated (ACQUISITION_AND_TRGOUT) or not (ACQUISITION_ONLY) through the TRGOUT
# options: DISABLED, ACQUISITION_ONLY, ACQUISITION_AND_TRGOUT

# GROUP_TRG_ENABLE_MASK: this option is used only for the Models x740. These models have the
# channels grouped 8 by 8; one group of 8 channels has a common trigger that is generated as
# the OR of the self trigger of the channels in the group that are enabled by this mask.
# options: 0 to FF
