********************************************************************************

The goal of data analysis is to convert raw run data from the digitizer into
cross sections for each target. In addition, this directory contains several
diagnostic and plotting tools.

The ROOT data analysis framework is required to compile and use the analysis
code in this directory. Histograms, graphs, and trees representing experimental
data and results are stored in .root files. Each step of data analysis maps
an input file to a ROOT file, which is in turn the starting point for the next
step of analysis, as follows:

  Data file     | Contents                                                      
----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------
1) .evt file    | This is the raw run data produced by the digitizer.       
----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------
2) raw.root     | Data from the .evt file is stored as a ROOT tree.    
----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------
3) sorted.root  | Data from raw.root is separated by channel and event type,
                | with each event uniquely identified by its macropulse and
                | order within that macropulse.                               
----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------
4a) histos.root | DPP-mode data from sorted.root is populated into histograms,
                | some useful for calculating the cross section and some for
                | disagnostics of the run.          
----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------
4b) waveform    | Waveform-mode data from sorted.root is analyzed to create a
    .root       | deadtime correction for DPP mode data.
----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------
5) cross-       | TOF histos from histos.root, deadtime corrections from
   sections     | waveform.root, and target data are combined to produce cross
   .root        | sections.   
----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------
6) sum.root     | Each sub-run's cross sections are combined to produce cross
                | sections for the entire run.
----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------
7) total.root   | Each runs's cross sections are combined to produce cross
                | sections for all runs specified in runsToSort.txt

This tiered approach requires more disk space (the ROOT files contain redundant
data), but it allows for re-analyzing to be much faster (e.g., once sorted.root
has been produced, subsequent analysis starts there instead of the beginning).

Executable    | Function
--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------
driver        | The main function for conducting analysis. This manages file
              | input/output and calls appropriate sub-routines that produce the
              | ROOT files detailed above.
--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------
text          | Takes a digitizer output file and produces a pretty-print text
              | file listing event data. The text files produced can be several
              | times the size of the input file.
--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------
sumRun        | Called by driver to sum sub-runs into a total for an entire run.
--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------
sumAll        | Called by driver to sum all specified runs into a total for an
              | entire experiment.
--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------
finetimeCheck | Creates plots showing the time delay between events on two
              | separate channels so that the user can adjust their delay.
--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------
readLitData   | Reads in literature data and creates cross section plots,
              | allowing comparison with previous results
