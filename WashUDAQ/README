Installing the DAQ software
---------------------------

Run the install script in this directory with the name of the DAQ version you
want to install as an argument, e.g.:

    ./install.sh washudaq-2.9-002


Verifying/updating digitizer firmware
---------------------------

Download and run the CAENUpgrader (freely available from CAEN Company:
www.caen.it). Follow CAENUpgrader documentation for firmware updates. Firmware
files used in this analysis package are stored in

    firmware/

in this directory.


Configuring your setup to start taking data
-------------------------------------------

The digitizer configuration is specified by 

    config.txt
    dppconfig.txt
    waveformconfig.txt

in the prodConfig and testConfig directories. When running in production mode,
the configuration is read from the prodConfig directory. When running in test
mode, the configuration is read from the testConfig directory.
    
During a run, data are directly recorded from the digitizer to a "staging area"
(for fastest transfer from the digitizer). The staging area should be able to
handle incoming data at rates well in excess of your expected average data rate
to avoid bottlenecking. A staging area must be specified by the user in

    stagingArea.txt
    
If a staging area is not specified by the user, wudaq.sh will abort before
starting the run and complain that it doesn't know where to record data.

After the end of the run, all data are moved to a "storage area" for
offline analysis and long-term storage. This storage area should be large
enough to store all run data for an experiment and must be specified by the
user in

    storageLocation.txt
    
If a suitable storage location is not specified by the user, wudaq.sh will not
move data from the staging area to the storage area at the end of each run.
Depending on the data rate, the staging area can quickly fill up with data and
preclude new data acquisition.

The minimum required free space in the staging and storage areas needed to start
a new run (in MB) is specified in

    minFreeSpace.txt

If a minimum free space is not specified by the user OR the staging and storage
areas don't have enough free space, wudaq.sh will abort before starting the run.


Collecting data (i.e., "starting a run")
------------------------

Running

    ./wudaq.sh -p

          OR

    ./wudaq.sh -t
    
tells the digitizer to start a new run in either production (-p) or testing (-t)
modes.

| -p    | Production mode. This will prompt the user for important            |
|       | experimental details about the run (e.g., voltages of the detectors |
|       | how many sub-runs to attempt) and save them along with the config   |
|       | files for the run for use in analysis.                              |
|       | Data is recorded as several 'sub-runs' (individual files) under an  |
|       | umbrella 'run' (a directory).                                       |
--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------
| -t    | Testing mode. This attempts to collect a single run and prompts the |
|       | user for a location where this test run should be stored.           |
