How to collect data
------------------------

Run ./wudaq.sh to start recording data on the digitizer. Optionally, ./wudaq.sh
can be run with the following arguments to modify its behavior:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Flag  | Behavior                                                            | 
--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------
| -p    | Production mode. This will prompt the user for important            |
|       | experimental details about the run (e.g., voltages of the detectors |
|       | how many sub-runs to attempt) and save them along with the config   |
|       | files for the run (in ./prodConfig) for use in analysis.            |
|       | Data is recorded as several 'sub-runs' (individual files) under an  |
|       | umbrella 'run' (a directory).                                       |
--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------
| -t    | Testing mode. This attempts to collect a single run and prompts the |
|       | user for a location where this test run should be stored.           |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When data is recorded from the digitizer, it is first kept in a staging area,
then moved to a storage location for more permanent storage. The filepaths for
these locations is set in ./stagingLocation and ./storageLocation.


Installing the DAQ software
---------------------------

Run the ./install script in this directory, passing the name of the version to
install as a parameter (e.g., ./install washudaq-2.9-002).


Verifying/updating digitizer firmware
---------------------------

Run the CAENUpgrader from the CAENUpgrader directory. Select the appropriate
digitizer model and action (e.g., updating firmware) and indicate the location
of the new firmware (if updating). Firmware files are stored in ./firmware.
