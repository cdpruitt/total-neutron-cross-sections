# Individual Settings 
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# The following settings are usually applied on channel by channel
# basis; however, you can put them also in the [COMMON] section in
# order to apply them to all the channels. If settings appear in
# both the common and individual sections, the value lower in this
# file takes precedence.

# of each bank to set the RECORD_LENGTH for each bank. The even channel must have input
